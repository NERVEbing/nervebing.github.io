          RPC.response.status.code
          HTTP
          RPC
          Description
      
  
  
      
          0 - OK
          200
          OK
          Not an error; returned on success.
      
      
          1 - CANCELLED
          499
          Client Closed Request
          The operation was cancelled, typically by the caller.
      
      
          2 - UNKNOWN
          500
          Internal Server Error
          Unknown error.  For example, this error may be returned when a Status value received from another address space belongs to an error space that is not known in this address space. Also errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information may be converted to this error.
      
      
          3 - INVALID_ARGUMENT
          400
          Bad Request
          The client specified an invalid argument.  Note that this differs from FAILED_PRECONDITION.  INVALID_ARGUMENT indicates arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g., a malformed file name).
      
      
          4 - DEADLINE_EXCEEDED
          504
          Gateway Timeout
          The deadline expired before the operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully.  For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire.
      
      
          5 - NOT_FOUND
          404
          Not Found
          Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found.Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class of users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented whitelist,NOT_FOUND may be used. If a request is denied for some users within a class of users, such as user-based access control, PERMISSION_DENIED must be used.
      
      
          6 - ALREADY_EXISTS
          409
          Conflict
          The entity that a client attempted to create (e.g., file or directory) already exists.
      
      
          7 - PERMISSION_DENIED
          403
          Forbidden
          The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation. PERMISSION_DENIED must not be used for rejections caused by exhausting some resource (use RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED instead for those errors). PERMISSION_DENIED must not be used if the caller can not be identified (use UNAUTHENTICATED instead for those errors). This error code does not imply the request is valid or the requested entity exists or satisfies other pre-conditions.
      
      
          8 - RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
          429
          Too Many Requests
          Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space.
      
      
          9 - FAILED_PRECONDITION
          400
          Bad Request
          The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation&rsquo;s execution.  For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE: (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher level (e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence). (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an &ldquo;rmdir&rdquo; fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.
      
      
          10 - ABORTED
          409
          Conflict
          The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort.See the guidelines above for deciding between FAILED_PRECONDITION,ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE.
      
      
          11 - OUT_OF_RANGE
          400
          Bad Request
          The operation was attempted past the valid range.  E.g., seeking or reading past end-of-file.Unlike INVALID_ARGUMENT, this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current file size.There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and OUT_OF_RANGE.  We recommend using OUT_OF_RANGE (the more specific error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an OUT_OF_RANGE error to detect when they are done.
      
      
          12 - UNIMPLEMENTED
          501
          Not Implemented
          The operation is not implemented or is not supported/enabled in this service.
      
      
          13 - INTERNAL
          500
          Internal Server Error
          Internal errors.  This means that some invariants expected by the underlying system have been broken.  This error code is reserved for serious errors.
      
      
          14 - UNAVAILABLE
          503
          Service Unavailable
          The service is currently unavailable.  This is most likely a transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with a backoff.See the guidelines above for deciding between FAILED_PRECONDITION,ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE.
      
      
          15 - DATA_LOSS
          500
          Internal Server Error
          Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.
      
      
          16 - UNAUTHENTICATED
          401
          Unauthorized
          The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the peration.

This error code does not imply the request is valid or the requested entity exists or satisfies other pre-conditions. 8 - RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED 429 Too Many Requests Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space. 9 - FAILED_PRECONDITION 400 Bad Request The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation’s execution. For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE: (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher level (e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence). (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an “rmdir” fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory. 10 - ABORTED 409 Conflict The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort.See the guidelines above for deciding between FAILED_PRECONDITION,ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE. 11 - OUT_OF_RANGE 400 Bad Request The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or reading past end-of-file.Unlike INVALID_ARGUMENT, this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current file size.There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and OUT_OF_RANGE. We recommend using OUT_OF_RANGE (the more specific error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an OUT_OF_RANGE error to detect when they are done. 12 - UNIMPLEMENTED 501 Not Implemented The operation is not implemented or is not supported/enabled in this service. 13 - INTERNAL 500 Internal Server Error Internal errors. This means that some invariants expected by the underlying system have been broken. This error code is reserved for serious errors. 14 - UNAVAILABLE 503 Service Unavailable The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with a backoff.See the guidelines above for deciding between FAILED_PRECONDITION,ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE. 15 - DATA_LOSS 500 Internal Server Error Unrecoverable data loss or corruption. 16 - UNAUTHENTICATED 401 Unauthorized The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the peration.
